## Hey there üëã

<p>
I'm Murilo Ramos, but you can call me Cohako.
On a daily basis, I'm mostly using Ruby on Rails, but being a beginner
developer who still has a lot to learn, I always try to discover new things!

My developer career started when I applied for a study position on the [Treinadev](https://treinadev.com.br/) project in 2021.
There I fell in love with the world of development.

   Did you know that the platypus is the only aquatic mammal that lays eggs and is venomous. In addition, it utilizes sensors that detect electrical variations to lock and glow when placed in UV light?
